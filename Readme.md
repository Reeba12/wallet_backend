You typically use the `mysqldump` command in a command-line interface or terminal on the machine where MySQL is installed. Here are common scenarios where you might use the `mysqldump` command:

1. **Backup a MySQL Database:**
   - Open a command-line interface or terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to store the backup file.
   - Run the `mysqldump` command to create a backup file.

   Example:
   ```bash
   mysqldump -u username -p database_name > backup.sql
   ```

2. **Restore a MySQL Database:**
   - Open a command-line interface or terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where the backup file is located.
   - Run the `mysql` command to restore the database from the backup file.

   Example:
   ```bash
   mysql -u username -p database_name < backup.sql
   ```

3. **Scheduled Backups with Cron (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows):**
   - Create a script that includes the `mysqldump` command.
   - Use a scheduling tool like cron on Linux/macOS or Task Scheduler on Windows to automate the backup process.

4. **Database Migration:**
   - When migrating a MySQL database from one server to another, you can use `mysqldump` to create a backup on the source server and then transfer the backup file to the destination server for restoration.

Remember to replace `username` with your actual MySQL username, `database_name` with the name of the database you want to back up or restore, and adjust the filenames and paths as needed. Additionally, when using the `-p` option, you'll be prompted to enter the MySQL user's password.
